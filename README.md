1.Introduction to Git: Understanding the basics and importance of version control systems. 
2.Git Installation and Setup: Step-by-step guide to installing Git and configuring essential settings.
3.Repository Management: Creating, cloning, and managing repositories.
4.Basic Commands: Fundamental commands like git init, git add, git commit, git status, and git log.
5.Branching and Merging: Working with branches, merging changes, and resolving conflicts.
6.Collaboration with Git: Using Git for collaborative development, including pushing, pulling, and fetching changes. 
7.Remote Repositories: Setting up and managing remote repositories on platforms like GitHub.
The Git session by HotWax with Mr. Shannee Ahirwar was super helpful. I've improved a lot with Git.
