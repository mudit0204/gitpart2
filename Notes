Born in 2005 after Linux community's fallout with BitKeeper.

Git States:
Modified: Changed but not committed.
Staged: Marked for next commit.
Committed: Changes stored permanently.

Basic Workflow:

Key Commands:
git add, git commit, git clone.

Branching:
Allows parallel development, merging combines changes.

Merge Conflicts:
Occur when conflicting changes made in different branches on same file.

Pushing Changes to GitHub:
